:Description:
    There has been a lot of work on migrating eZ Components to the Apache
    Incubator and therefore in direction of Apache Zeta Components. This post
    gives a status update in direction of infrastructure, processes and plans
    for the near future.
:Abstract:
    It's been a while since Apache Zeta Components was `officially accepted for
    incubation`__ in the Apache Software Foundation in May 2010. Since then, a
    lot of progress has been made, especially in the area of technical
    infrastructure and code drop. So, it's time to present the current status
    of the project and ask you to actively take part in the community!

--------------
Infrastructure
--------------

There's been a lot of work on the technical infrastructure for Zeta. First off,
we have a `new SVN`__, which you should use from now on to obtain the Zeta
code. We did not roll an official release yet, mostly due to the fact that the
release process is right now in discussion, to be adjusted to ASF needs.

__ https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/zetacomponents

The project mandatory mailing lists have been set up. So, if you want to
contribute and take part in the community, please register for
`zeta-dev@incubator.apache.org`__. If you are only using Zeta Components,
please use the `user mailinglist at zeta-user@incubator.apache.org`__ to
discuss issues with other users. However, the developer mailinglist is also
open for questions and problems. If you want to be up to date on commits to the
SVN repository, you should subscribe to `zeta-commits@incubator.apache.org`__
and if you want to help fixing bugs, please subscribe to
`zeta-issues@incubator.apache.org`__.

__ mailto:zeta-dev@incubator.apache.org
__ mailto:zeta-users@incubator.apache.org
__ mailto:zeta-commits@incubator.apache.org
__ mailto:zeta-issues@incubator.apache.org

Subscribing to any of the Zeta mailing lists is easy. Just send an empty email
to

::

    zeta-*-subscribe@incubator.apache.org

so, for example for the dev list, email
`zeta-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org`__.

__ mailto:zeta-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org

We also have a new `issue tracker`__, which you can use to file bugs.
Furthermore, there is a `code browser`__ which you can use to inspect our
source code without downloading it or checking it out from SVN.

---------
Code drop
---------

`eZ Systems AS`__ has performed the so-called *code drop*, which essentially
means that the complete eZ Components SVN history was sent to the ASF and a
contract was signed which completes the donation. Furthermore, Ole Marius
Smestad from eZ Systems has performed license and copyright changes after the
code was imported to `our new SVN`__. So, the (now) Zeta Components code is
from now on licensed under the `Apache License 2.0`__. For you as a user, this
does not change much, since the Apache License is basically as permissive as
the former New BSD license was.

__ http://ez.no
__ https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/zetacomponents
__ http://apache.org/licenses/

At this place, we want to take the opportunity to thank eZ Systems a lot for
donating the eZ Components source code base to the ASF and therefore making
Apache Zeta Components possible.

-------------
Contributions
-------------

Quite some contributions to Apache Zeta Components are in discussion on the
developer mailinglist:

Jerome Renard and James Pic joined forces for providing an `overrider
mechanism`__ for the Configuration component. This technique should allow you
to specify multiple directories for configuration files (INIs) of which the
first contains default values and all further ones can override these defaults.
This is especially useful in large applications and for application modules.

Gustavo Solt from the PHProject__ team is implementing a `proof-of-concept for
CalDAV support`__ for the Webdav component. CalDAV is an extension to WebDAV,
which allows to synchronize calendars to a central server. CalDAV was already
in mind when the Webdav component was originally started a couple of years ago,
but time did not permit to implement it until now. Therefore, we are happily
looking forward to this contribution.

There are some more enhancements in discussion on the mailinglist, so please
subscribe there, if you want to take part in designing and/or implementing
those! Furthermore, we are actively looking for contributors. So, if you use
Zeta Components (or still eZ Components) and have a cool idea, found a bug or
just want to provide a helping hand, please `subscribe to
zeta-dev@incubator.apache.org`__ and join our team!
