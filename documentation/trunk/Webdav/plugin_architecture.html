component an introduction on how to implement new plugins. If you just want to use the Webdav component, this document does not contain any relevant information for you.</p><div class="attention"><p>The Plugin-API is not part of the Webdav component in version 1.0, but will be part of a later release.</p></div><a name="overview"></a><a name="id2"></a><h3>Overview</h3><p>The Webdav component provides a flexible plugin architecture to extend the features of the component. A plugin is a certain set of classes, that represents a certain functionality for the component. Every plugin must ship a class that extends <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavPluginConfiguration.html'>ezcWebdavPluginConfiguration</a> and is used to add the plugin to the component.</p><p>To interact with the component, a plugin can assign an unlimited number of callbacks to so called "hooks" which are offered by certain parts of the component. A hook indicates that a certain event has occured inside the component and informs plugins about this event. A plugin callback will receive a defined number of parameters, wrapped into an instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebavPluginParameters.html'>ezcWebavPluginParameters</a>, it may work on and even possibly alter.</p><p>A callback assigned to a hook should usually not return anything, because procesing of further callbacks will be stopped immediatelly in this case. Therefore, a plugin callback usually returns null and interacts with the component through the received parameters. Some special hooks expect a plugin callback to return a certain object to stop processing of further callbacks by intention and to inject a certain object into the component. If this is the case, it is explicitly mentioned in the hook description.</p><a name="plugin-configuration"></a><a name="id3"></a><h3>Plugin configuration</h3><p>Every plugin must provide a class that extends <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavPluginConfiguration.html'>ezcWebdavPluginConfiguration</a> and is used to activate the plugin in the server. This class is instantiated by the user and submitted to <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavPluginRegistry.html#registerPlugin'>ezcWebdavPluginRegistry-&gt;registerPlugin</a>(). After that, the plugin is registered and active.</p><p>The configuration class expects 2 abstract methods to be implemented, which are used by the server to determine all necessary information about the plugin:</p><dl><dt>getNamespace()</dt><dd>This method must return a string, representing a unique identifier for the plugin, called the namespace of the plugin. This sting should usually reflect the plugins name for clearity. A good namespace identifier would e.g. be "<a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavLockPlugin.html'>ezcWebdavLockPlugin</a>".</dd><dt>getHooks()</dt><dd>The server calls this method on the configuration object to receive an array containing all hooks the plugin wants to assign to, including the callbacks for each hook. The detailed structure of this definition can be found in the Webdav API docs.</dd></dl><p>Additionally, the server will call the init() method on the configuration object, which by default does nothing. A plugin can overwrite this method, to perform any kind of setup work.</p><a name="hooks"></a><a name="id4"></a><h3>Hooks</h3><p>Plugin hooks are catgorized by the class that issues them. 3 classes of the Webdav component currently support the following plugin hooks:</p><a name="ezcwebdavtransport"></a><a name="id5"></a><h4>ezcWebdavTransport</h4><p>The <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavTransport.html'>ezcWebdavTransport</a> class offers hooks that are related to request parsing and response handling. To give you the most comfortable way of interacting with these processes, for each of the request parsing and response handling methods offer a "before" and an "after" hook. The "before" hook is announced right before the speicifc method is invoked, while "after" announcement happens right after the method has been called.</p><p>Additionally a hook for parsing unknown requests and one for handling unknown response objects is announced if such cases occur.</p><a name="beforeparsecopyrequest"></a><a name="id6"></a><h5>beforeParseCopyRequest</h5><p>This hook is announced right before a COPY request is parsed. It retrieves the parameters</p><dl><dt>path</dt><dd>The path contained in the request URI, already transformed by an <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavPathFactory.html'>ezcWebdavPathFactory</a>, as a string.</dd><dt>body</dt><dd>The body contained in the request as a string.</dd></dl><p>Both parameters are submitted by reference, so any changes made to them will have effects on other mechanisms accessing those. Therefore, all manipulations must be performed very carefully.</p><p>The return value of callbacks assigned to this hook will be ignored and therefore may not occur, since processing of additional callbacks will be stopped as soon as a return value is send.</p><a name="afterparsecopyrequest"></a><a name="id7"></a><h5>afterParseCopyRequest</h5><p>Analogous to the "before" hook of this method, this hook is announced right after a COPY request has been parsed.

The hook should be used by plugins for 2 reasons:</p><ol><li><p>React on request objects without affecting the further process.</p></li><li><p>React on request objects, but replacing the further process.</p></li></ol><p>If a plugin just wants to be informed about certain requests, it must not return a value from its callback. If this is the case, further callbacks assigned to this hook will be processed.</p><p>In the second case, the plugin wants to take care for processing the request itself and must return an instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavResponse.html'>ezcWebdavResponse</a> afterwards. If this is the case, dispatching of callbacks for this hook is stopped and the generatedResponse hook is announced for the response, right before it is send to <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavTransport.html'>ezcWebdavTransport</a> for being serialized and send. Note that the processing of the request by the backend will not take place in this case. If the backend should still take care about a request, no return value may be returned by any assigned callback.</p><p>A plugin may choose to handle a request completly on its own and may use any of the public API that is provided by the server, that is create new request objects and let them get processed by server and backend.</p><p>Parameters submitted to this hook are:</p><dl><dt>request</dt><dd>The instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavRequest.html'>ezcWebdavRequest</a> that was received from <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebavTransport.html'>ezcWebavTransport</a>.</dd></dl><p>Any changes made to the parameter will have effects on other mechanisms accessing it.

Therefore all manipulations must be performed very carefully and should be avoided if possible.</p><a name="api"></a><a name="id68"></a><h3>API</h3><p>Every plugin may access any public API elements of the Webdav component to perform any necessary tasks. To access the correct module for the right task, plugins should follow the following hints to ensure correct working.</p><a name="central-server"></a><a name="id69"></a><h4>Central server</h4><p>The central entrance point of the Webdav component is the class <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavServer.html'>ezcWebdavServer</a>, which coordinates all other modules. The singleton instance of this class acts also as the central registry for all modules, which can be accessed through the servers properties, once it is initialized.</p><p>The singleton instance of the server can be access using <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavServer.html#getInstance'>ezcWebdavServer-&gt;getInstance</a>() and offers the following attributes to be used by plugins:</p><dl><dt>$pathFactory</dt><dd>This attribute contains the instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavPathFactory.html'>ezcWebdavPathFactory</a> that has been configured by the user to be used. In most cases, a plugin will not need to access this one, since it only acts on processed pathes. Only if new request data is parsed or response data needs to be serialized, a plugin might need to access to path factory to parse an URI into a path or the other way around.</dd><dt>$xmlTool</dt><dd>The instance of eczWebdavXmlTool is used in the transport layer and while dealing with properties. When dealing with parsing/processing request or response data, this attribute of the server should be accessed for XML handling. In case of property related hooks, the XML tool to use will be provided as a parameter, which _must_ be used in this case.</dd><dt>$propertyHandler</dt><dd>The property handler object stored in this attribute is used to parse live and dead properties from XML and serialize them to XML. A plugin can also make use of this functionality. The attribute contains an instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavPropertyHandler.html'>ezcWebdavPropertyHandler</a>.</dd><dt>$headerHandler</dt><dd>Analogous to $propertyHandler, this attribute contains an instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavHeaderHandler.html'>ezcWebdavHeaderHandler</a>, which can be used by a plugin to access and parse headers sent with the request.</dd><dt>$transport</dt><dd>The main element of the transport layer is kept in this attribute: An instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavTransport.html'>ezcWebdavTransport</a>, which is responsible for parsing requests and for serializing and sending of responses. Normally, a plugin should not need to access this attribute.</dd><dt>$backend</dt><dd>The backend used by the server is hold in this attribute, an instance of <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavBackend.html'>ezcWebdavBackend</a>. While a plugin could theoretically access the backends methods directly, it is recommended to interact with it using request and response objects. A newly created request object can be send to the backend using <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavBackend.html#performRequest'>ezcWebdavBackend-&gt;performRequest</a>() which will return a response object for evaluation. This will work with every backend, while non-standardized methods might be missing in certain backends, which might break the plugin.</dd></dl><a name="data-transport"></a><a name="id70"></a><h4>Data transport</h4><p>It often occurs, that a plugin needs to store data related to an infrastructural element of the component (request/response/property) and to access this data later during the request. To avoid that every plugin needs to implement a storage engine for this on its own, all infrastructual objects allow you to attach certain data to them and read this data later. Note that the data is not presistent between requests, but is only valid during the request.</p><p>Intfrastructural elements are all instances of</p><ul><li><p>ezcWebdavRequest</p></li><li><p>ezcWebdavRepsonse</p></li><li><p>ezcWebdavProperty</p></li></ul><p>and derived classes. All of these extend <a href='/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/Webdav/phpdoc/ezcWebdavInfrastructureBase.html'>ezcWebdavInfrastructureBase</a>, which offers the data storage mechanism for plugins.</p><p>To attach data to such an object, the method setPluginData() is used, expecting the namespace of the plugin a key for the data and the data itself. Later, the data can be restored from the same object, by using its getPluginData() with the namespace and key. The methods hasPluginData() and removePluginData() are also available to maintain the storage.</p><!--Local Variables:
