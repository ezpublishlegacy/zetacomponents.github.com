Further resources
=================

There are a few things to remember when you want to contribute code to the
project:

* To add functionality the whole `development process`__ should be followed.
* All new functionality has to be documented.
* Contributors must grant us the right to include their contribution. When
  contributing code, please submit a `CLA (Contributor Licensing Agreement)`__
  to the Apache Software Foundation.
* You have to keep backwards compatibility.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, we suggest you have a look at the detailed
`development process`__ first.

Bugfixes are of course always welcome. If you want to help out with bugs simply
pick a bug and fix it in svn trunk (or the latest supported version with the
problem). When you are done, add the patch as an attachment to the bugreport.
If you are planning to solve bugs, or if you just want to avoid duplicate work
or need some information, send an email to the relevant mailinglist first so we
know what you want to do.
